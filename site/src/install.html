<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>{{global.name}} should not be installed in any application. This is a standalone framework that generate a CSS you can copy into your website or app assets folder.</p>

<p>However, you can install {{global.name}} in your Node.js website or app if you only want to use its helpers and mixins.</p>

<div class="warn">
  <h4>Warning</h4>
  <p>{{global.name}} uses the new <a href="https://sass-lang.com">Dart-Sass</a> module system. So, you are strongly encouraged to import helpers and mixins modules you need with the <code>@use</code> rule. The old <code>@import</code> rule will be soon deprecated from Sass. See <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use">https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use</a>.</p>
