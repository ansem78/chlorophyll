<p>{{global.description}}</p>

<p>{{global.name}} is a featured CSS utilities framework which aims to help UI designers to quickly build websites an web-based apps from scratch. It can be used either standalone or easily integrated with other web frameworks, especially those that lacks utilities for layout, text alignment, positioning, etc. {{global.name}} does <strong>NOT</strong> make available any class to style colors, form inputs or buttons. It focuses on utility classes to format structure and any element on a page.</p>

<h4>Features</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Modularity</strong>: {{global.name}} follows a concept of <em>features</em>. Any major set of utility classes is part of a feature, and any feature can be configured independently, as well as enabled or disabled.</li>
  <li><strong>Highly configurable</strong>: You can configure only variable you need to override. And you can enable or disable features and their modules.</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile-first</strong>: {{global.name}} follows a modern mobile-first philosophy. However, its responsive utilities make it suitable for development for any device.</li>
  <li><strong>Lightweight</strong>: any <code>@import</code> rule (in CSS) or <code>&lt;link /&gt;</code> element (in HTML) do a HTTP call. To reduce the amount of these calls, {{global.name}} generates a single CSS file. The features system contributes to keep the CSS size as small as possible, based on features you really need.</li>
  <li><strong>Unopinionated</strong>: Any generated CSS rule is limited to style a single visual aspect for an element. Only the <a href="/features/reset">reset</a> feature has opinionated rules, because it makes the appearance of any HTML element consistent across browsers.</li>
  <li><strong>Complete</strong>: {{global.name}} expresses CSS full potential. From simple formatting rules to animations and transformations. It also has utility classes to improve accessibility and readability, to truncate text and embed third-party media.</li>
</ul>
