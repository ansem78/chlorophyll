### Installation

{{global.name}} should not be installed in any application. This is a standalone framework that generate a CSS you can copy into your website or app assets folder.

However, you can install {{global.name}} in your Node.js website or app if you only want to use its helpers and mixins.

Warning: {{global.name}} uses the new Dart-Sass module system. So, you are strongly encouraged to import helpers and mixins modules you need with the @use rule. The old @import rule will be soon deprecated from Sass. See [https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use).
