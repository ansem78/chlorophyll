{{global.description}}

{{global.name}} is a featured CSS framework which aims to help UI designers to quickly build websites an web-based apps from scratch. It can be used either standalone or easily integrated with other web frameworks, especially those that lacks utilities for layout, text alignment, positioning, etc. {{global.name}} does __NOT__ make available any class to style colors, form inputs or buttons. It focus on pages and elements structure, and give you a set of predefined utilities to change some basic elements behavior, like text alignment or letter spacing. It also integrate a set of utilities to easily animate or transform elements.

{{global.name}} follows a concept of __features__. Any major set of classes is part of a feature, and any feature can be configured independently, as well as enabled (if you need it) or disabled (if you don't). Any `@import` rule (in CSS) or `<link />` element (in HTML) do a HTTP call. To reduce the amount of these calls, {{global.name}} generates a single CSS file. The features system contributes to keep the CSS size as small as possible.
